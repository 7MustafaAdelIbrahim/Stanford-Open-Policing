### ***Stanford Open Policing Project dataset***.
dataset of traffic stops by ***police officers**** that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project. 
They've collected data from ***31 US states***. Currently, a comprehensive, national repository detailing interactions between police and the public doesn’t exist.
That’s why the Stanford Open Policing Project is collecting and standardizing data on vehicle and pedestrian stops from law enforcement departments across the country
and we’re making that information freely available. 
The Stanford Open Policing Project, are an interdisciplinary team of researchers and journalists at Stanford University. They are committed to combining the academic rigor of statistical analysis with the explanatory power of data journalism. They’ve already gathered over ***200 million records*** from dozens of state and local police departments across the country. but we'll be focusing on data from the state of ***Rhode Island***. 
For size reasons, some of the columns and rows have been removed, but you can download the full dataset for any of the 31 states from [the project's website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

***50,000*** americans are pulled over by police everyday.
There’re many different interactions with police that have ended tragically, such as ***the arrest of Sandra bland*** in Texas in 2015 that ended up with her dying in jail, and the Minnesota stop with ***falando Castillo*** where he was shot and killed, those were really egregious incidents.


I tried to analyze the dataset and find battery, draw larger conclusions about the police officers activities
we found that black and Hispanic drivers are ticketed searched and arrested at ‎higher rates than white drivers even after controlling for location age gender in here the pattern is widespread occurring  throughout the country 

The black drivers were more likely to be charged with the drug  related offenses ‎prior to legalization  the policy changed mitigated racial  disparity.
what's interesting is that the  number of searches also dramatically  decline in ‎both states in part this is  because legalizing recreational  marijuana removed a common reason for  conducting searches.

these differences highlighted asperity in police practices  in and of themselves  ‎the statistics do indicate racial discrimination.   
for example that  officers searched white drivers of  there's a 10% chance or ‎greater that  they can contraband but there's black  drivers there's a 5% chance or greater  this is going to be emitted at  discrimination


We have tried to answer some questions, such as...
          
Do the genders or race commit different violations?
Does gender or race  affect who gets a ticket for speeding?
Does gender or race affect whose vehicle is searched?
Calculating the search rate and Comparing search rates by gender.
Comparing speeding outcomes by gender and race.
Does gender and race affect who is frisked during a search?
Does gender and raceaffect who is frisked during a search?
Examining the search types.
Calculating the inventory rate 
Counting protective frisks.
During a vehicle search, 
the police officer may pat down the driver to check if they have a weapon. This is known as a "protective frisk.
Comparing frisk rates by gender.   
Does time of day affect arrest rate?
Calculating the hourly arrest rate.
Are drug-related stops on the rise?
Comparing drug and search rates.       
What violations are caught in each district?
Tallying violations by district
How long might you be stopped for a violation?
