### ***Stanford Open Policing Project dataset***.
dataset of traffic stops by ***police officers**** that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project. 
They've collected data from ***31 US states***. Currently, a comprehensive, national repository detailing interactions between police and the public doesn’t exist.
That’s why the Stanford Open Policing Project is collecting and standardizing data on vehicle and pedestrian stops from law enforcement departments across the country
and we’re making that information freely available. 
The Stanford Open Policing Project, are an interdisciplinary team of researchers and journalists at Stanford University. We are committed to combining the academic rigor of statistical analysis with the explanatory power of data journalism. They’ve already gathered over ***200 million records*** from dozens of state and local police departments across the country. but we'll be focusing on data from the state of ***Rhode Island***. 
For size reasons, some of the columns and rows have been removed, but you can download the full dataset for any of the 31 states from [the project's website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

***50,000*** americans are pulled over by police everyday.
